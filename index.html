            <p>I could write about myself right here. I love to sing and dance.
                I'm not particularily artistic, but if I'm told what to create I love to make things.
                I think building websites would be cool for that because I can build it the way someone else wants it to
                look.</p>

            </div class="aboutme">

            <p>I have 5 kids and a husband that I love very much.
                I danced all through my childhood and now my kids dance.
                I sang in a college choir and we sang at Carnagee Hall, which was super cool.
                A few years ago I had a rare side effect which caused Intracranial Hypertension.
                This caused me to lose chunks of memory and I wasn't able to read.
                Thankfully now I am better but I will likely never regain those memories
                and I have had to reteach myself how to learn and increase reading comprehension.
