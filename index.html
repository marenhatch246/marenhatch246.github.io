                <h2>About Me</h2>
            </div class="aboutme">

            <p>I am an enthusiastic and dedicated aspiring Front-End Web Developer on a mission to transition a career
                built on high-stakes client support into the world of code. Through the Tech-Mom beginner course, I
                gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and discovered a deep interest in how
                technology works behind the scenes. This structured environment gave me the foundational knowledge to
                not only understand how websites are built, but also how to debug issues, manage version control with
                Git, and translate design concepts into responsive, functional code.</p>

            <p>My unique advantage, however, comes from my decade of experience as a Direct Support Professional and
                Doula. These roles weren't about writing code, but they demanded the kind of critical thinking, crisis
                management, and attention to detail that software development requires. I specialized in taking complex,
                high-stress, and often ambiguous situations—whether a client's behavioral plan or a delivery room
                protocol—and translating them into clear, actionable, and meticulously documented processes. If I can
                manage complex, confidential patient information under HIPAA guidelines, I can certainly manage your
                project files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, my education is continuous. While I continue to build my portfolio and deepen my
                expertise independently, I plan to pursue relevant certifications as my career progresses, ensuring my
                skills remain current and validated by industry standards. I approach every project with the goal of
                creating solutions that are not just technically sound, but also deeply empathetic to the end-user's
                needs. I'm not just learning to code; I'm leveraging my professional past to become a more thoughtful
                and reliable developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am eager to join a team where I can keep learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and apply both
                empathy and analytical thinking to real-world technical challenges.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Over several years in healthcare and high-stakes client support, I cultivated robust professional
                strengths in communication, systems thinking, and critical problem-solving. My background involved
                meticulously coordinating complex care plans, managing sensitive documentation (HIPAA), and proactively
                troubleshooting intricate client workflows. This experience has given me a proven foundation in
                efficiency, detail-orientation, and user advocacy—the essential skills for a confident transition into
                technology.
